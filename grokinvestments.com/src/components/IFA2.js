                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>Can you tell us about yourself? Please include any details you feel comfortable sharing about how long you’ve been in the US, what you do for a living and your income range.</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> I am an old-time immigrant from India that came to the US in 1979, so I will say I’ve been here for about 40 years. Fortunately, I entered the US through the proper channel with a green card in my hand, which helped me to pursue jobs and education without some of the immigration issues some people face. Even though I was college educated, adjusting to a new culture and having to understand the American accent, as well as my accent, was sort of a short-term barrier. I took the job that was available for survival regardless of my qualifications. My goal was to continue my education and obtain a degree from an accredited university in order to land a professional level job, which was an ambition my family cultivated in me as well as my 9th-grade teacher. I worked for the City of Portland, Oregon, for more than 31 years, and for 24 of those years as a Financial Analyst. My income range was between $80,000 and $99,000.</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>What was your relationship with money during the early days of your life? How did it influence your finances?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> I had minimal access to money during my earlier days. I had minimal resources, even to meet the bare minimum necessities during my younger days. I wouldn’t change that experience for anything. Such an experience made me appreciate every penny I made. It also allows me to have genuine empathy for those who don’t have the means to live. I started earning my own money after I came to the US. I was the most frugal person. I only bought what I really needed, and it was not easy to indulge when I had some extra.</p>
                      <div className="blog-divider"></div>
                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>What are some money mistakes you have committed? What lessons did you learn from it?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b>I did not have lots of money during the earlier days of my life due to raising a family of five, having a mortgage, car payments and by meeting the usual young family needs. So, there wasn’t much left to make money mistakes. However, during the latter part of my career, I could have taken a calculated risk with some of my retirement funds which could have raised my monthly pension a bit higher. It was primarily due to the financial collapse of 2008. Basically, I moved everything to a low earning safe investment. I planned to retire in 2013 and I did. The market went up another 25% during those five years. I feel it is better to be safe than sorry. I do not think I wasted any money but I could have made more money.</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>What is your view on debt? Do you carry any form of debt? Has it ever been a source of stress in your life?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> I did not grow up with debt. Debt should not be a part of your life. Buy when you have money. Borrow if it is an emergency, I mean a real emergency. Debt is essential for most people to buy a house or a car, at times for college education (unless the money is used for non-educational recreation). I had debts and still have some small debt. Yes, it does give me a certain amount of stress, but it is limited since my assets exceed far beyond my debt.</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>How is your money invested? Does being an immigrant have any influence on your investment decisions?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> I have some money invested with one of the investment companies. Most funds are invested in a portfolio consisting of diversified companies. Being an immigrant, and mostly living with less than what I need, investment is not a subject I grew up with or even thought about. I started learning some of the opportunities for investing money with the help of experienced colleagues when I started working in the US. I did invest money in mutual funds in addition to my retirement during my career.</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>Do you have any specific money situation as an immigrant (e.g. supporting an aging parent or family overseas) that influences your finances?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> Yes, I did have an aging parent to support. In addition, I supported siblings, friends, and other organizations. Some of these things were a priority to me over investing. Yes, I could have invested more for myself, but the opportunity to support some of the people I mentioned cannot be matched by any investments.</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>What are some of the apps or tools you use to manage your finances?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> I never used any apps other than what I created myself in an Excel spreadsheet. I do short term, interim, and long-range planning. In addition to the usual living expenses, I do factor in future infrequent expenses such as capital replacement costs for my house and one-time special events. Honestly, nothing works as planned, but at least it helped buffer me from surprises and reactive bad debts. Yes, debt is a debt, and mine is at least a calculated/planned debt. At least I know where I am going and what is in my way. I believe that is half of the equation!</p>

                      <p className="f-color"><b>Question: </b>What money advice do you have for new immigrants who arrive in the US?</p>
                      <p><b>Answer: </b> Do not fall into consumerism. Short term fun is like fireworks, they last for a few seconds. Aim long term and be a steady light like a lantern. It takes a few years of sacrifice to invest for a fruitful long-term rich living, no pun intended. I worked multiple jobs and caught up on homework during the weekends for a good four years to get where I want to be. Yes, it was not fun at all. I worked for the next 30 years with an above average income and am now enjoying an early retirement with a pension for the rest of my life. I think the four years of sacrifice was well worth it.</p>
