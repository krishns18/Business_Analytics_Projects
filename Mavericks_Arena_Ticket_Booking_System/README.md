## Mavericks Arena Ticket Booking System

#### Introduction
Mavericks Arena is a fictitious organization that falls under the business sector of the amphitheater industry. Mavericks Arena stages both indoor and outdoor shows. The shows include stage plays, dance, musicals, movies, and performances associated with local youth cricket, football, and rugby teams.  
The amphitheater is a commercial center that attracts customers day in and day out. Since many simultaneous events happen at the amphitheater, an efficient booking system is required to handle the humongous amount of data related to various show bookings, their seat reservations, including printing of tickets. For the project, we wanted to model the database of such an organization that is capable of handling simultaneous transactions of show listings, theater management, customer bookings, seat reservations, and ticket printing. Hence, we came up with the concept of Mavericks Arena.

#### Entities
Mavericks Arenaâ€™s schema consists of multiple entities. Below mentioned are the details for each of the entities.

- **Shows**: It contains the list of all the shows and their attributes such as name, description, owner, start date, and end date. A show can either be indoor or outdoor, which is denoted by its show type.
- **Theater**: It contains the listing of all the theaters in the Maverick Arena and their attributes, such as name, manager, seating capacity, and theater level. Mavericks Arena is a multi-level amphitheater; hence theaters are located either at the lower or upper level.
- **Manager**: In the manager entity, details of all the theater managers such as first and last name, contact details (email and phone), and their residential address are stored.
